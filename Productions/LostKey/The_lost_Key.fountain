I have to find it. Whatever it is.

Oh no. Who are they?

The group surrounds her.

LEADER
What are you doing here?

JESSICA
I'm just looking for something.

What kind of something?

JESSICA
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

What's in the chest?

Just some old things.

Let me see.

A map to what?

(to herself)
I shouldn't have come here.

Jessica holds up the key.

LEADER
That's just a key. What's so important about it?

JESSICA

Interesting. Let's go see what's inside.

You shouldn't have come here.

Who are you?

MAN
My name is Jack. You have something that belongs to me.

JESSICA
I don't know what you're talking about.

JACK
The wooden chest. It belongs to me.

JESSICA
I found it. It's mine.

JACK
That may be true, but the contents of the chest belong to me.

JESSICA
What's in the chest?

JACK
Something very valuable. Something I've been searching for my whole life.

Jessica thinks for a moment.

JESSICA
What if we work together? Maybe we can both benefit from whatever's inside.

JACK
I don't work with others. It's just me, myself, and I.

JESSICA
(to herself)
I have to find a way to get that chest back.

INT. CAFÉ - DAY

Jessica is sitting at a table in a café. She's going through the old journal she found in the safe deposit box.

WAITRESS
Can I get you anything else?

JESSICA
No, I'm good. Thank you.

As the waitress walks away, a man sits down at Jessica's table.

MAN
You must be Jessica.

JESSICA
Who are you?

MAN
My name is David. I heard about your search for the lost key.

JESSICA
How did you hear about that?

DAVID
I have my sources. I may be able to help you.

JESSICA
What kind of help?

DAVID
I know Jack. He's not an easy man to work with, but I may be able to convince him to let you keep the chest.

JESSICA
What do you want in return?

DAVID
I want to see what's inside the chest. I'm a collector of rare artifacts, and I have a feeling that whatever's inside is something I've been looking for.

Jessica thinks for a moment.

JESSICA
Okay, you have a deal.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Jessica, David, and Jack are in an abandoned warehouse. Jack is holding the wooden chest.

JACK
I don't know if I can trust you.

DAVID
You can trust me. I'm just interested in seeing what's inside.

JESSICA
Please, just let me have the chest.

JACK
(to Jessica)
And what will you do with it?

JESSICA
I'll give you whatever's inside.

Jack thinks for a moment.

JACK
Okay, you can have the chest. But I'll be watching you.

Jessica takes the chest and opens it. She pulls out an old, rusty key.

JESSICA
(to David)
Is this what you were looking for?

DAVID
Yes, that's it. That's the key to the lost city.

JACK
(to Jessica)
And what will you do with the city?

JESSICA
I'll find whatever's inside and hopefully uncover the truth about my father's disappearance.

JACK
And what will you do with the treasure?

JESSICA
I'll use it to help people. That's what my father would have wanted.

David takes the key and looks at it with excitement.

(to Jessica)
I'll help you find the city.

JESSICA
Thank you.
